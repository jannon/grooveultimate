  bio: 			Sam is a nonstop engine on offense that finds ways to get open whenever you need her to be. Her play has very few flaws that some experts argue she is a robot but it's heavily disputed because she digs too much groove in her game to be made of wires and metal. Others believe she is the descendant of flying squirrels because of her ability to layout.

  bio: 			"Copti escaped from a top-secret military installation when she was 8 after being injected with an experimental serum that gave her superhuman speed, coordination, and jumping ability. She's been on the run ever since, basically never stopping, strangely drawn to hovering plastic and its utter annihilation. When not sending opponents fleeing in face-melting terror or absorbing the surrounding power of the universe, she enjoys fixing people's bodies, cycling, and climbing."

Although she's known for her hustle, her hucks and handles are great too. Boys beware she's not afraid to poach the throwing lanes and sky you if you happen to cut deep near her."

  bio:      "Meet one of our newest groovy additions: our adorbs babyfaced pun-wielding O-Bro, Kyle aka Ky~e (pronounced something like Kyrrrrrr, with slightly nasal overtone). After migrating from a college-land far far away named Duke, and more recently from Yosemite rangering, Ky~e wasted no time impressing all with his zippy cuts, ear-to-ear-grinning full field hucks, and did I mention those big blue eyes? First he (bow)wowed us on SFWL's Dog(e)patch, and then served up such delectable Deep Dish at Lei Out that we simply couldn't resist. After a brief tug-of-war with the Molar Hairs (names have been changed to protect privacy) during tryouts, Groove emerged victorious and luckily was able to claim Kyle an officially *Groovy Dude 2014* (TM). Also luckily his grooviness came naturally. From bestowing nickname gems like Puddles to scaling walls of breweries, to hosting World Cup viewings at his casa, to ensuring the Groove-Me is ever-replete with puns, Ky~e fit right in. Now he's off exploring Norwegian woods, and our fingers are crossed that he doesn't get scooped up by some Scandinavian goddess-model (though for his sake this would admittedly be amazing) and instead returns for Groove 2015."
